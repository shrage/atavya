# Enhancement Proposal Verification

## Overview

This document defines the verification process for enhancement proposals (EPs) in the AI Documentation Framework. Verification ensures that implemented EPs meet their intended objectives and are properly documented.

## Human-AI Collaboration in Verification

The verification process follows the human-AI collaboration model:

1. **AI Initial Verification**: The AI assistant performs initial verification against defined criteria
2. **Human Final Verification**: The human project manager reviews and makes the final verification decision
3. **AI Documentation**: The AI assistant documents the verification process and results
4. **Human Approval**: The human project manager approves the verification documentation

## Verification Process

### 1. Initial Verification (AI Responsibility)

The AI assistant performs initial verification by:

1. Reviewing the EP's implementation against its requirements
2. Checking that all required files and components have been created
3. Verifying that the implementation follows the framework's standards
4. Testing the functionality if applicable
5. Documenting the verification results

### 2. Verification Report (AI Responsibility)

The AI assistant creates a verification report that includes:

1. Summary of verification findings
2. Checklist of verification criteria with pass/fail status
3. Any issues or concerns identified
4. Recommendations for addressing issues

### 3. Final Verification (Human Responsibility)

The human project manager reviews the verification report and:

1. Confirms that the implementation meets requirements
2. Identifies any issues not caught in initial verification
3. Makes the final verification decision
4. Provides feedback on the verification process

### 4. Documentation Update (AI Responsibility)

The AI assistant updates documentation based on the final verification:

1. Updates the EP's verification status
2. Documents any issues and their resolution
3. Updates the EP registry
4. Updates framework version information if applicable

## Verification Criteria

### Implementation Verification
- [ ] All required core files have been created or updated
- [ ] All required templates have been created or updated
- [ ] All required directories have been created
- [ ] All required integrations with existing components have been completed

### Functionality Verification
- [ ] Core functionality works as described in the EP
- [ ] Edge cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets expectations

### Documentation Verification
- [ ] EP has been updated with implementation details
- [ ] EP has been updated with an outcome section
- [ ] EP registry has been updated with the EP's status
- [ ] Framework documentation has been updated to reflect the changes

### Integration Verification
- [ ] Implementation works with existing components
- [ ] Implementation works with other implemented EPs
- [ ] Framework version has been updated to reflect the changes

## Verification Status

After completing the verification process, the AI assistant recommends an EP verification status, and the human project manager makes the final determination:

- **Not Verified**: The EP has not been verified
- **Partially Verified**: Some aspects of the EP have been verified, but not all
- **Verified**: The EP has been fully verified

## Verification Documentation

The AI assistant documents the verification process in the EP's Verification section:

```markdown
## Verification
- [ ] Not Verified
- [ ] Partially Verified
- [x] Verified

### Verification Details
Verification completed on YYYY-MM-DD.

#### Implementation Verification
- All required core files have been created or updated
- All required templates have been created or updated
- All required directories have been created
- All required integrations with existing components have been completed

#### Functionality Verification
- Core functionality works as described in the EP
- Edge cases are handled appropriately
- Errors are handled gracefully
- Performance meets expectations

#### Documentation Verification
- EP has been updated with implementation details
- EP has been updated with an outcome section
- EP registry has been updated with the EP's status
- Framework documentation has been updated to reflect the changes

#### Integration Verification
- Implementation works with existing components
- Implementation works with other implemented EPs
- Framework version has been updated to reflect the changes
```

## Verification Responsibility

In the human-AI collaboration model:

**AI Assistant Responsibilities**:
- Perform initial verification against all criteria
- Document verification results
- Recommend verification status
- Update documentation based on human approval

**Human Project Manager Responsibilities**:
- Review AI verification results
- Perform additional verification if needed
- Make final verification decision
- Approve documentation updates

## Verification Timing

Verification should be performed as soon as possible after implementation is complete, but no later than the next framework version release.

The AI assistant should proactively initiate the verification process when an EP implementation is complete, rather than waiting for the human project manager to request verification.
