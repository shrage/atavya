# AI Documentation Framework: Project Initializer

## Overview

This document defines the initialization process for projects using the AI Documentation Framework. It outlines the steps for analyzing a new project, creating the initial directory structure, and establishing baseline documentation.

## Project Analysis Phase

Before creating any documentation, analyze the project to understand its structure, architecture, and context:

### 1. Repository Structure Analysis
- Identify key directories and files
- Determine the project's organization pattern
- Identify existing documentation

### 2. Architecture Analysis
- Locate architecture documentation
- Identify architectural patterns and principles
- Understand component relationships
- Document extension points and customization mechanisms

### 3. Technology Stack Analysis
- Identify programming languages and frameworks
- Document build and deployment processes
- Identify third-party dependencies
- Understand testing frameworks

### 4. Domain Analysis
- Identify domain-specific terminology
- Understand business rules and constraints
- Document industry-specific patterns
- Identify user roles and personas

## Directory Structure Creation

Create the following directory structure to organize documentation:

```
.ai/
├── context.md                    # Project context overview
├── work_units/                   # Work tracking
│   ├── registry.md               # Work unit registry
│   └── project_tracker.md        # Project progress tracking
├── requirements/                 # Requirements documentation
│   ├── domain-specific/          # Domain-specific requirements
│   └── cross-cutting/            # Cross-cutting requirements
├── features/                     # Feature documentation
├── user_flows/                   # User journey documentation
├── design/                       # Design documentation
├── tests/                        # Test specifications
├── guides/                       # How-to guides
├── mocks/                        # Mock designs and analysis
│   └── analysis/                 # Analysis of mocks
├── documentation/                # General documentation
│   └── architecture/             # Architecture documentation
└── _core/                        # Framework core files
    ├── workflow_patterns.md      # Workflow patterns
    ├── project_initializer.md    # This file
    ├── meta_self_detection.md    # Framework improvement detection
    └── conversation_monitoring.md # Conversation monitoring
```

Not all directories need to be populated immediately. Create only what's needed based on the project's scope and complexity.

## Initial Documentation Creation

Create the following baseline documentation:

### 1. Project Context (context.md)
Document the project's purpose, scope, and context:
- Project overview
- Key stakeholders
- Business objectives
- Technical goals
- Constraints and assumptions

### 2. Architecture Summary
Create an architecture summary document in `.ai/documentation/architecture/`:
- High-level architecture overview
- Component relationships
- Key patterns and principles
- Extension points
- Integration mechanisms

### 3. Work Unit Registry
Initialize the work unit registry in `.ai/work_units/registry.md`:
- Define the registry structure
- Create placeholder for work units
- Establish hierarchy visualization

### 4. Project Tracker
Create a project tracker in `.ai/work_units/project_tracker.md`:
- Overall project status
- Key milestones
- Current focus areas
- Blockers and risks

## Work Unit Template

Create a template for work units that includes:

```markdown

## Architecture Analysis Guidelines

When analyzing a project's architecture, focus on:

1. **Architectural Patterns**:
   - Identify the overall architectural style (e.g., microservices, monolith)
   - Document key patterns used (e.g., MVC, CQRS)
   - Understand the layering approach

2. **Component Relationships**:
   - Identify major components and their responsibilities
   - Document dependencies between components
   - Understand communication patterns

3. **Extension Points**:
   - Identify customization mechanisms
   - Document plugin or extension systems
   - Understand configuration approaches

4. **Integration Mechanisms**:
   - Document APIs and interfaces
   - Understand event systems
   - Identify integration patterns

## Conclusion

The project initialization process establishes the foundation for effective documentation and work management. By analyzing the project thoroughly and creating appropriate baseline documentation, the framework can provide maximum value throughout the project lifecycle.
