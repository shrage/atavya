# Human-AI Responsibility Matrix

This document clearly defines the responsibilities of the human project manager and the AI assistant across all aspects of the AI Documentation Framework. This matrix serves as a reference for both parties to understand their roles and expectations.

## Documentation Creation

| Activity | Human Project Manager Responsibility | AI Assistant Responsibility |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Initial requirements | Provide clear requirements and context | Ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding |
| Documentation structure | Approve structure or request changes | Propose structure options based on requirements |
| Content creation | Provide domain expertise and key information | Generate comprehensive content based on requirements and context |
| Review | Review content and provide feedback | Implement feedback and make improvements |
| Finalization | Approve final version | Format, finalize, and integrate with existing documentation |

## Enhancement Proposals

| Activity | Human Project Manager Responsibility | AI Assistant Responsibility |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Problem identification | Identify problems or approve AI-identified problems | Proactively identify documentation gaps and improvement opportunities |
| Proposal creation | Provide input on requirements and priorities | Draft detailed enhancement proposals |
| Evaluation | Evaluate proposals and make approval decisions | Provide analysis, recommendations, and impact assessment |
| Implementation | Approve implementation plan | Implement approved proposals |
| Verification | Perform final verification and approval | Perform initial verification and present results |

## Work Unit Management

| Activity | Human Project Manager Responsibility | AI Assistant Responsibility |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Work unit definition | Define or approve work unit scope | Propose work unit structure and breakdown |
| Prioritization | Set priorities for work units | Recommend prioritization based on dependencies |
| Status tracking | Review and approve status updates | Track and update work unit status |
| Completion verification | Verify work unit completion | Perform initial verification and document completion |
| Documentation | Provide domain-specific information | Create and maintain work unit documentation |

## Maintenance and Updates

| Activity | Human Project Manager Responsibility | AI Assistant Responsibility |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Trigger identification | Approve update triggers | Identify when updates are needed |
| Update planning | Approve update plan | Propose update approach and scope |
| Implementation | Review critical updates | Implement updates across documentation |
| Reconciliation | Review reconciliation reports and approve actions | Perform reconciliation and generate detailed reports |
| Version management | Approve version changes | Track and update version information |

## Project Initialization

| Activity | Human Project Manager Responsibility | AI Assistant Responsibility |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Project selection | Select project for documentation | Analyze project structure and recommend approach |
| Initial setup | Approve initialization approach | Create initial documentation structure |
| Technology detection | Confirm detected technologies | Detect technologies and frameworks used |
| Documentation planning | Approve documentation plan | Propose documentation plan based on project analysis |
| Template selection | Approve template selection | Recommend appropriate templates |

## Knowledge Management

| Activity | Human Project Manager Responsibility | AI Assistant Responsibility |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Knowledge identification | Identify critical domain knowledge | Detect knowledge that should be documented |
| Knowledge validation | Validate accuracy of documented knowledge | Document knowledge in structured format |
| Knowledge organization | Approve knowledge organization | Organize knowledge by domain and type |
| Knowledge updates | Provide updated domain information | Update knowledge documentation |
| Knowledge retrieval | Request specific knowledge | Retrieve and present relevant knowledge |

## Framework Evolution

| Activity | Human Project Manager Responsibility | AI Assistant Responsibility |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Improvement identification | Approve framework improvements | Identify opportunities for framework improvement |
| Enhancement proposals | Approve enhancement proposals | Draft enhancement proposals for framework |
| Implementation | Approve implementation approach | Implement approved framework changes |
| Verification | Verify critical framework changes | Verify and document framework changes |
| Version updates | Approve framework version updates | Update framework version documentation |

## Conflict Resolution

In cases where responsibilities overlap or conflict:

1. The human project manager has final decision-making authority
2. The AI assistant should present options with clear recommendations
3. The human project manager's explicit instructions override default responsibility assignments
4. The AI assistant should seek clarification when responsibilities are unclear

## Responsibility Evolution

This responsibility matrix will evolve as:
1. The human-AI collaboration model matures
2. AI capabilities expand
3. Human preferences change
4. Project requirements evolve

Updates to this matrix require human project manager approval.
