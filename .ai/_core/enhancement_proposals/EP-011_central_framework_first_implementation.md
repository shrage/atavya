# Enhancement Proposal: Central Framework First Implementation

## Metadata
- **ID**: EP-011
- **Title**: Central Framework First Implementation
- **Created**: 2025-03-28
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Author**: AI Assistant
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Related**: [EP-007: Central Framework Documentation System](./EP-007_central_framework_documentation.md), [EP-010: Human-AI Collaboration Model](./EP-010_human_ai_collaboration_model.md)

## Problem Statement

A critical design flaw has been identified in our enhancement proposal implementation process: changes are being made to project-specific instances rather than to the central AI Documentation Framework system. This creates several significant issues:

1. **Inconsistency Between Projects**: Different projects may implement enhancements differently
2. **No Central Source of Truth**: The central framework doesn't reflect the latest enhancements
3. **Version Tracking Issues**: Framework versions become meaningless when changes aren't applied centrally
4. **Inheritance Failure**: Projects can't properly inherit from the central framework
5. **Documentation Fragmentation**: Documentation becomes fragmented across projects

This flaw undermines the entire purpose of having a central framework and enhancement proposal system, as it prevents standardization and proper versioning of the framework.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a "Central Framework First" approach to enhancement proposal implementation:

1. **Central Implementation Mandate**: All enhancement proposals must be implemented in the central framework first
2. **Framework Version Control**: Each enhancement implementation triggers a framework version update
3. **Project Inheritance Protocol**: Define how projects inherit central framework changes
4. **Implementation Verification**: Verify that central changes are properly reflected in projects
5. **Documentation Synchronization**: Ensure documentation is synchronized between central and project instances

## Implementation Details

### 1. Central Framework and Project Instance Relationship

Clarify the relationship between the central framework and project instances:

```markdown
# Central Framework and Project Instance Relationship

## Structure
- The central framework resides within the `.ai` directory of each project
- Core framework files are in `.ai/_core/`
- Framework templates are in `.ai/templates/`
- Framework documentation is in `.ai/_framework_documentation/`

## Inheritance
- Projects inherit the central framework through their `.ai` directory
- When the central framework is updated, all project instances should be updated
- Project-specific customizations should extend, not replace, central framework files
```

### 2. Enhancement Proposal Implementation Process

Update the enhancement proposal lifecycle to enforce central implementation:

```markdown
# Enhancement Proposal Implementation Process

## 1. Central Framework Implementation

All enhancement proposals MUST be implemented in the central framework files first:

1. Update core framework files in `.ai/_core/`
2. Update framework templates in `.ai/templates/` if needed
3. Update framework documentation in `.ai/_framework_documentation/`
4. Update VERSION.md and CHANGELOG.md
5. Verify that all central framework files are properly updated

## 2. Project Adaptation

After central implementation is complete, ensure project-specific files are updated:

1. Ensure project-specific files are compatible with central framework changes
2. Update project-specific customizations if needed
3. Verify that central changes are properly reflected in the project
4. Update project documentation to reference new framework version
```

### 3. Framework Version Control

Enhance the version control system to track enhancement implementations:

```markdown
# Framework Version Control

## Version Numbering

The AI Documentation Framework follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- MAJOR: Breaking changes to the framework
- MINOR: New features and enhancements (including new EPs)
- PATCH: Bug fixes and minor updates

## Version Tracking

Each enhancement proposal implementation MUST increment the framework version:

1. Update VERSION.md with the new version number
2. Add the enhancement to the version's enhancement list
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with implementation details
4. Tag the repository with the new version
```

### 4. Project Inheritance Protocol

Define how projects inherit from the central framework:

```markdown
# Project Inheritance Protocol

## Initial Project Setup

When initializing a new project:

1. Reference the latest stable version of the central framework
2. Copy core files from the central framework
3. Initialize project-specific directories
4. Document the framework version in use

## Framework Updates

When updating a project to a new framework version:

1. Review the changelog for breaking changes
2. Update the framework version reference
3. Apply necessary changes to project-specific files
4. Verify compatibility with project requirements
5. Document the framework update
```

### 5. Implementation Verification Protocol

Establish a verification process for central implementation:

```markdown
# Central Implementation Verification

Before an enhancement proposal can be marked as "Implemented":

1. Verify that ALL changes have been made to the central framework
2. Verify that VERSION.md and CHANGELOG.md have been updated
3. Verify that documentation has been updated
4. Create a test project that inherits from the updated framework
5. Verify that the test project correctly inherits the changes
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All projects inherit from the same central framework
2. **Version Integrity**: Framework versions accurately reflect implemented enhancements
3. **Clear Inheritance**: Projects have a clear path to inherit central changes
4. **Documentation Coherence**: Documentation remains synchronized
5. **Standardization**: Implementation follows a standardized process

## Required Changes

1. Create new core files:
   - central_framework_first.md
   - project_inheritance_protocol.md
   - central_implementation_verification.md

2. Update existing core files:
   - enhancement_proposal_lifecycle.md (add central implementation requirement)
   - workflow_patterns.md (update to reflect central-first approach)
   - VERSION.md (update versioning protocol)
   - CHANGELOG.md (update changelog protocol)

3. Update templates:
   - enhancement_proposal_template.md (add central implementation section)
   - project_initialization_template.md (add framework version reference)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the central framework repository structure
2. Implement the central framework first approach
3. Update the enhancement proposal lifecycle
4. Enhance the version control system
5. Define the project inheritance protocol
6. Establish the implementation verification protocol
7. Update existing enhancement proposals to reflect this approach
