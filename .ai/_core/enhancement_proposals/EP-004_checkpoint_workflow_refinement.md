## Problem Statement

Our recent implementation of the conversation-based workflow checkpoints approach (EP-003) has revealed several practical gaps:

1. The transition between checkpoints lacks clear criteria for completion
2. Documentation practices during checkpoints are inconsistent
3. The relationship between work units and requirements documentation is unclear
4. There's confusion about when to create separate documentation vs. embedding in work units
5. The review process for each checkpoint isn't well-defined

These issues can lead to premature advancement through checkpoints, inconsistent documentation, and confusion about the current state of work.

## Proposed Solution

Refine the conversation-based workflow checkpoints approach with clearer guidelines, documentation practices, and transition criteria.

### 1. Checkpoint Completion Criteria

Define explicit completion criteria for each checkpoint:

#### Checkpoint 1: Requirements & Architecture Understanding
**Completion Criteria**:
- All requirements are documented in a dedicated requirements file
- User stories are created for each requirement
- Requirements are linked to architectural components
- Requirements document has been reviewed and approved
- Work unit has been updated with a reference to the requirements document

#### Checkpoint 2: Design Approach
**Completion Criteria**:
- Design approach is documented in a dedicated design file
- Component structure is defined
- Technical decisions are documented with rationale
- Design is aligned with architectural principles
- Design document has been reviewed and approved
- Work unit has been updated with a reference to the design document

#### Checkpoint 3: Implementation Plan
**Completion Criteria**:
- Implementation tasks are broken down in detail
- Dependencies between tasks are identified
- Testing approach is defined
- Implementation plan has been reviewed and approved
- Work unit has been updated with the implementation plan

#### Checkpoint 4: Implementation Review
**Completion Criteria**:
- All implementation tasks are complete
- Tests are passing
- Documentation is updated
- Code has been reviewed
- Implementation has been approved
- Work unit has been updated with implementation details

### 2. Documentation Practices

Establish clear documentation practices for each checkpoint:

#### Requirements Documentation
- Create a dedicated file in `.ai/requirements/[domain]/[component]_requirements.md`
- Include functional and non-functional requirements
- Add user stories for each requirement
- Link to architectural components
- Reference in the work unit

#### Design Documentation
- Create a dedicated file in `.ai/design/[component]_design.md`
- Include component structure
- Document technical decisions and rationale
- Include diagrams where appropriate
- Reference in the work unit

#### Implementation Plan
- Document directly in the work unit
- Break down into phases with specific tasks
- Include testing approach
- Document dependencies

#### Implementation Details
- Update the work unit with implementation summary
- Create how-to guides if needed in `.ai/guides/`
- Update API documentation if applicable

### 3. Checkpoint Conversation Flow

Define a structured conversation flow for each checkpoint:

#### Checkpoint 1: Requirements & Architecture Understanding
1. Review existing documentation and architecture
2. Draft requirements and user stories in a dedicated file
3. Share the link with the user for review
4. Wait for explicit approval before marking checkpoint as complete
5. Update work unit with reference to approved requirements

#### Checkpoint 2: Design Approach
1. Review approved requirements
2. Draft design approach in a dedicated file
3. Share the link with the user for review
4. Wait for explicit approval before marking checkpoint as complete
5. Update work unit with reference to approved design

#### Checkpoint 3: Implementation Plan
1. Review approved design
2. Draft implementation plan in the work unit
3. Present the plan for review
4. Wait for explicit approval before marking checkpoint as complete
5. Update work unit status

#### Checkpoint 4: Implementation Review
1. Complete implementation according to plan
2. Update documentation
3. Present implementation for review
4. Wait for explicit approval before marking checkpoint as complete
5. Update work unit status and completion

### 4. Work Unit and Documentation Relationship

Clarify the relationship between work units and documentation:

- Work units track progress and status
- Requirements, design, and other detailed documentation live in dedicated files
- Work units reference these documents rather than duplicating content
- Updates to documentation are reflected in work unit status

## Implementation Details

### Updates to Framework Files

#### workflow_patterns.md
Add a new section on "Checkpoint Completion Criteria and Documentation Practices":

```markdown
## Checkpoint Completion Criteria and Documentation Practices

Each checkpoint in the workflow has specific completion criteria and associated documentation practices:

### Checkpoint 1: Requirements & Architecture Understanding
**Completion Criteria**:
- All requirements are documented in a dedicated requirements file
- User stories are created for each requirement
- Requirements are linked to architectural components
- Requirements document has been reviewed and approved
- Work unit has been updated with a reference to the requirements document

**Documentation Practices**:
- Create a dedicated file in `.ai/requirements/[domain]/[component]_requirements.md`
- Include functional and non-functional requirements
- Add user stories for each requirement
- Link to architectural components
- Reference in the work unit

### Checkpoint 2: Design Approach
**Completion Criteria**:
- Design approach is documented in a dedicated design file
- Component structure is defined
- Technical decisions are documented with rationale
- Design is aligned with architectural principles
- Design document has been reviewed and approved
- Work unit has been updated with a reference to the design document

**Documentation Practices**:
- Create a dedicated file in `.ai/design/[component]_design.md`
- Include component structure
- Document technical decisions and rationale
- Include diagrams where appropriate
- Reference in the work unit

### Checkpoint 3: Implementation Plan
**Completion Criteria**:
- Implementation tasks are broken down in detail
- Dependencies between tasks are identified
- Testing approach is defined
- Implementation plan has been reviewed and approved
- Work unit has been updated with the implementation plan

**Documentation Practices**:
- Document directly in the work unit
- Break down into phases with specific tasks
- Include testing approach
- Document dependencies

### Checkpoint 4: Implementation Review
**Completion Criteria**:
- All implementation tasks are complete
- Tests are passing
- Documentation is updated
- Code has been reviewed
- Implementation has been approved
- Work unit has been updated with implementation details

**Documentation Practices**:
- Update the work unit with implementation summary
- Create how-to guides if needed in `.ai/guides/`
- Update API documentation if applicable
```

#### conversation_monitoring.md
Add a new section on "Checkpoint Transition Protocol":

```markdown
## Checkpoint Transition Protocol

When transitioning between checkpoints, follow this protocol:

1. **Verify Completion Criteria**:
   - Check that all completion criteria for the current checkpoint are met
   - Ensure all required documentation is created and approved

2. **Update Work Unit Status**:
   - Mark the current checkpoint as "Confirmed"
   - Document the approval date and any notes
   - Update references to documentation

3. **Prepare for Next Checkpoint**:
   - Summarize the current state and next steps
   - Identify any dependencies or blockers
   - Outline the approach for the next checkpoint

4. **Seek Explicit Approval**:
   - Present the checkpoint status and next steps
   - Ask for explicit approval to proceed
   - Document the approval in the work unit
```

### Update Work Unit Template

Add a "Documentation References" section to the work unit template:

```markdown
## Documentation References
- **Requirements**: [Link to requirements document]
- **Design**: [Link to design document]
- **How-To Guides**: [Links to relevant guides]
- **API Documentation**: [Links to API docs]
- **Test Specifications**: [Links to test specs]
```

## Benefits

This enhancement will provide:

1. Clearer guidelines for checkpoint completion
2. More consistent documentation practices
3. Better traceability between work units and documentation
4. Improved review process for each checkpoint
5. Clearer communication about current state and next steps

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the framework core files with the new sections
2. Create templates for requirements and design documentation
3. Update the work unit template with documentation references
4. Apply the refined approach to current work units
5. Document the changes in the framework documentation

## Conclusion

By refining our conversation-based workflow checkpoints approach with clearer guidelines and documentation practices, we can improve the effectiveness of our workflow, ensure consistent documentation, and maintain better traceability between work units and their associated documentation.
