# AI Documentation Framework: Conversation Monitoring

## Overview

This document defines how the AI Documentation Framework monitors conversations to detect key patterns, track progress through checkpoints, and maintain context. Effective conversation monitoring ensures that important information is captured and appropriate actions are taken.

## Checkpoint Detection and Processing

### Detecting Checkpoint Opportunities

Monitor conversations for opportunities to initiate checkpoints:

1. **Checkpoint 1 Opportunities**:
   - When requirements discussion appears complete
   - After analyzing architecture documents
   - When the user asks about next steps after requirements discussion

2. **Checkpoint 2 Opportunities**:
   - After discussing design approaches
   - When component design details are established
   - When the user asks about implementation approaches

3. **Checkpoint 3 Opportunities**:
   - After outlining implementation steps
   - When discussing implementation details
   - Before starting actual implementation

4. **Checkpoint 4 Opportunities**:
   - After implementation is complete
   - When discussing testing results
   - When the user asks about implementation status

### Checkpoint Conversation Patterns

When a checkpoint opportunity is detected, use these conversation patterns:

#### Checkpoint 1: Requirements & Architecture Understanding
```
Based on our discussion, I understand that:
1. [Summarize key requirements]
2. [Note architectural considerations]
3. [Highlight constraints or assumptions]

Does this align with your expectations? Would you like me to proceed with designing an approach, or is there anything we should clarify first?
```

#### Checkpoint 2: Design Approach
```
Here's my proposed approach for implementing this:
1. [Outline component design]
2. [Describe implementation patterns]
3. [Explain integration points]

Does this approach make sense to you? Should we adjust anything before I start planning the implementation details?
```

#### Checkpoint 3: Implementation Plan
```
Here's my implementation plan:
1. [List implementation steps]
2. [Note integration points]
3. [Outline testing approach]

Are you comfortable with me proceeding with this implementation plan? Any adjustments you'd like to make?
```

#### Checkpoint 4: Implementation Review
```
I've completed the implementation according to our plan. Here's a summary:
1. [Summarize what was implemented]
2. [Note any deviations from the plan]
3. [Highlight test results]

Does this implementation meet your expectations? Any adjustments you'd like to make?
```

### Processing Checkpoint Responses

When the user responds to a checkpoint:

1. **For Confirmation**:
   - Update the work unit's checkpoint status to "Confirmed"
   - Document key decisions and understanding
   - Proceed to the next phase
   - Update relevant documentation as needed

2. **For Clarification Requests**:
   - Address the specific questions or concerns
   - Refine understanding based on feedback
   - Re-present the checkpoint when ready

3. **For Adjustments**:
   - Incorporate requested changes
   - Update understanding and plans
   - Re-present the checkpoint when ready

## Documentation Need Detection

Monitor conversations to detect when documentation updates are needed:

### Requirements Documentation Needs
- Discussion of new features or capabilities
- Clarification of existing requirements
- Identification of constraints or assumptions

### Design Documentation Needs
- Discussion of component design
- Explanation of implementation patterns
- Description of interfaces or APIs

### User Flow Documentation Needs
- Discussion of user interactions
- Description of user journeys
- Explanation of UI behaviors

### How-To Guide Needs
- Explanation of implementation approaches
- Description of usage patterns
- Discussion of extension mechanisms

## Work Unit Status Tracking

Monitor conversations to track work unit status:

1. **Creation Triggers**:
   - Starting work on a new feature or component
   - Breaking down a larger task into smaller units
   - User request to create a work unit

2. **Status Update Triggers**:
   - Completion of a checkpoint
   - Implementation progress
   - Resolution of blockers
   - Completion of tasks

3. **Completion Triggers**:
   - All implementation tasks complete
   - All tests passing
   - User confirmation of completion

## Context Maintenance

Maintain conversation context through:

1. **Key Decision Tracking**:
   - Identify and document important decisions
   - Note rationale for decisions
   - Track changes to decisions

2. **Requirement Evolution**:
   - Track changes to requirements
   - Document clarifications
   - Note scope changes

3. **Implementation Progress**:
   - Track completed implementation steps
   - Note deviations from plans
   - Document challenges and solutions

## Documentation Update Triggers

Identify when documentation should be updated:

1. **After Checkpoint 1**:
   - Update requirements documentation (if needed)
   - Create initial feature documentation (if needed)
   - Create test specifications (if needed)
   - Update architecture documentation (if needed)

2. **After Checkpoint 2**:
   - Update design documentation (if needed)
   - Create user flows (if needed)
   - Refine feature documentation (if needed)

3. **After Checkpoint 3**:
   - Finalize implementation plan in work unit

4. **After Checkpoint 4**:
   - Create how-to guides (if needed)
   - Update test documentation (if needed)
   - Finalize relevant documentation (if needed)

## Conclusion

Effective conversation monitoring ensures that the AI Documentation Framework captures important information, maintains context, and progresses through checkpoints appropriately. By following these patterns, the framework can provide consistent and valuable support throughout the development process.
