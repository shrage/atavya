**Actions**:
1. Update EP status to "Verified"
2. Update verification status in EP
3. Add verification details to EP
4. Update registry

### Any State to Superseded

**Trigger**:
- New EP supersedes this one

**Actions**:
1. Update EP status to "Superseded"
2. Add reference to superseding EP
3. Update registry

## Lifecycle Responsibilities

### EP Author

- Create initial EP draft
- Respond to feedback and make revisions
- Update EP with implementation details if they are the implementer

### EP Reviewer

- Review EP for completeness and clarity
- Provide feedback on proposed EP
- Recommend approval, rejection, or revision

### EP Approver

- Make final decision on EP approval
- Document approval or rejection

### EP Implementer

- Implement EP according to specifications
- Update EP with implementation details
- Update EP registry

### EP Verifier

- Verify implementation against specifications
- Update EP with verification details
- Update EP registry

## Lifecycle Documentation

### EP Registry

The EP registry maintains the current status of all EPs:

```markdown
# Enhancement Proposal Registry

## Active Enhancement Proposals

### EP-XXX: Title
- **Status**: [Lifecycle State]
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Implementation**: [Not Started|In Progress|Completed]
- **Verification**: [Not Verified|Verified]
- **Path**: [./EP-XXX_title.md](./EP-XXX_title.md)

## Completed Enhancement Proposals

### EP-YYY: Title
- **Status**: Verified
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Implementation**: Completed
- **Verification**: Verified
- **Path**: [./EP-YYY_title.md](./EP-YYY_title.md)
- **Outcome**: [Brief description of implementation outcome]
```

### EP Status Updates

Each EP should be updated with its current status:

```markdown
## Metadata
- **ID**: EP-XXX
- **Title**: Title
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: [Draft|Proposed|Approved|In Progress|Implemented|Verified|Rejected|Superseded]
- **Author**: Author
- **Priority**: [Low|Medium|High|Critical]
- **Related**: [Related EPs]
```

### Implementation Status Updates

Each EP should be updated with its implementation status:

```markdown
## Implementation Status
- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [x] Completed

## Implementation Details
[Details about the actual implementation]
```

### Verification Status Updates

Each EP should be updated with its verification status:

```markdown
## Verification
- [ ] Not Verified
- [x] Verified

### Verification Details
[Details about verification process and results]
```

## Lifecycle Integration with Framework

### Conversation Monitoring

Conversation monitoring should detect EP lifecycle transitions:

1. **Implementation Start Detection**:
   - Detect when implementation of an EP begins
   - Prompt for EP status update

2. **Implementation Completion Detection**:
   - Detect when implementation of an EP completes
   - Prompt for EP status update and implementation details

3. **Verification Detection**:
   - Detect when verification of an EP occurs
   - Prompt for verification details and outcome documentation

### Framework Version Updates

Framework version should be updated when EPs are implemented:

1. **Minor Version Increment**:
   - When new features are added through EPs

2. **Patch Version Increment**:
   - When bug fixes or minor improvements are made through EPs

3. **Major Version Increment**:
   - When breaking changes are made through EPs
