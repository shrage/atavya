# Component Library Requirements

## Metadata
- **Type**: Technical Requirement
- **Status**: Active

- **Related Work Units**: [WU-008: UI Component Library](../../work_units/WU-008_ui_component_library.md)
- **Related User Stories**: Multiple component user stories
- **Related Standards**: [Atavya Style Guide](../../standards/design/style_guide.md)

## Overview

The Atavya platform requires a comprehensive component library and a dedicated component viewer application. This system allows UI developers to test and showcase components in isolation, provides documentation for component usage, and serves as a living style guide for the platform.

## Goals

- Create a structured component directory for organized component development
- Provide a standalone component viewer application for testing and showcasing components
- Enable developers to view components with sample data without launching the entire application
- Serve as documentation for UI developers to understand available components and their usage
- Standardize component implementation patterns and ensure consistency
- Facilitate component development and testing in isolation

## Component Directory Structure

The component library will be organized in the following structure:

```
/src/components/
│
├── core/                  # Core UI building blocks
│   ├── Button/
│   ├── Input/
│   ├── Select/
│   ├── Modal/
│   └── ...
│
├── common/                # Common components used across the platform
│   ├── EntityHeader/
│   ├── CommunicationTab/
│   ├── NotificationPanel/
│   └── ...
│
├── entities/              # Entity-specific components
│   ├── default/           # Default entity components
│   │   ├── EntityView/
│   │   ├── EntityList/
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── hvac/              # HVAC-specific components
│   ├── property/          # Property management components
│   ├── professional/      # Professional services components
│   └── ...
│
└── custom/                # Organization-specific customizations
    ├── org1/
    ├── org2/
    └── ...
```

## Component Structure

Each component should follow a consistent structure:

```
/Button/
│
├── Button.jsx            # Component implementation
├── Button.stories.jsx    # Storybook stories
├── Button.test.jsx       # Unit tests
├── Button.module.css     # Component styles (if using CSS modules)
├── Button.docs.mdx       # Component documentation
└── index.js              # Export file
```

## Functional Requirements

### Component Implementation

1. **Core Components**
   - Implement all basic UI building blocks (buttons, inputs, selects, etc.)
   - Follow the Atavya design system style guide
   - Support all required variants, sizes, and states
   - Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Provide comprehensive prop validation

2. **Common Components**
   - Implement reusable components used across the platform
   - Compose using core components
   - Maintain consistent behavior across different contexts
   - Support customization through props

3. **Entity Components**
   - Implement default entity views and lists
   - Create industry-specific component variations
   - Support entity-specific functionality
   - Allow for customization and extension

4. **Custom Components**
   - Provide a structure for organization-specific customizations
   - Ensure customizations don't break core functionality
   - Document customization patterns and best practices

### Component Viewer Application

1. **Component Browser**
   - Categorize components by type (core, common, entity, custom)
   - Allow filtering and searching for components
   - Display component metadata and documentation
   - Support navigation between related components

2. **Component Renderer**
   - Display components with various props and states
   - Allow interactive prop modification
   - Show component in different contexts and sizes
   - Support dark/light mode toggle

3. **Documentation Viewer**
   - Display component documentation from MDX files
   - Show prop definitions and examples
   - Include usage guidelines and best practices
   - Provide code snippets for common use cases

4. **Props Editor**
   - Allow interactive modification of component props
   - Support all prop types (strings, numbers, booleans, objects, etc.)
   - Show prop descriptions and default values
   - Provide validation feedback for invalid props

5. **Device Simulator**
   - Allow testing components in different viewport sizes
   - Support common device presets (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Show responsive behavior of components
   - Enable rotation for testing orientation changes

## Technical Requirements

1. **Framework and Libraries**
   - Use React for component implementation
   - Use Storybook.js for the component viewer
   - Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests
   - Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling

2. **Documentation**
   - Use MDX for component documentation
   - Include prop definitions with types and descriptions
   - Provide usage examples and code snippets
   - Document accessibility considerations

3. **Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for all components
   - Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
   - Include visual regression tests
   - Test accessibility compliance

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize component bundle size
   - Implement code splitting for the component viewer
   - Ensure fast rendering performance
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders

5. **Deployment**
   - Automate component viewer deployment
   - Version component library releases
   - Provide a CDN for production usage
   - Support npm package distribution

## Integration Requirements

1. **Application Integration**
   - Components should be easily importable into the main application
   - Component styles should integrate with the application theme
   - Components should work with the application's state management
   - Components should support the application's routing system

2. **Storybook Integration**
   - Storybook should automatically detect and load component stories
   - Storybook should integrate with the design system
   - Storybook should support addons for accessibility, viewport, etc.
   - Storybook should be deployable as a standalone application

3. **Documentation Integration**
   - Component documentation should be accessible from the main application
   - Documentation should be searchable and filterable
   - Documentation should be versioned with the component library
   - Documentation should include live examples

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**
   - The component viewer should have an intuitive interface
   - Documentation should be clear and comprehensive
   - Components should have consistent APIs and behavior
   - Error messages should be helpful and actionable

2. **Maintainability**
   - Code should follow consistent patterns and style
   - Components should be well-documented internally
   - Dependencies should be kept to a minimum
   - Breaking changes should be clearly documented

3. **Extensibility**
   - The component library should be extensible for future needs
   - New component types should be easy to add
   - The component viewer should support new features through plugins
   - Custom theming should be supported

4. **Compatibility**

   - Components should be compatible with different React versions
   - The component viewer should work in different environments
   - Components should degrade gracefully in unsupported environments

## Implementation Constraints

- Development server for the Component Viewer should be separate from the main application
- Components should be able to mock their dependencies for isolated testing
- The Component Viewer should support both production and development builds
- Sample data should be easily configurable for different scenarios

## Traceability
