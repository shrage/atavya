# Component Registry System Proposal

## Problem Identified
During our conversation on 2025-03-27, we identified that the current work tracking approach doesn't provide sufficient granularity for tracking individual UI components. Specifically:

1. There's no clear way to see which custom field components were planned vs. implemented
2. It's difficult to track the status of individual components across the library
3. There's no connection between the PRD requirements and the actual implementation
4. Work units are too high-level to effectively track component-level progress

## Proposed Solution: Component Registry System

I propose enhancing the AI Documentation Framework with a component registry system that would:

1. **Track Individual Components**: Maintain a detailed registry of all planned and implemented components
2. **Link to Requirements**: Connect each component to its source requirements in the PRD
3. **Track Implementation Status**: Provide clear status tracking for each component
4. **Support Prioritization**: Allow for component prioritization and roadmap planning

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Create a Component Registry Structure

```
{project_path}/.ai/
└── component_registry/
    ├── README.md                    # Registry documentation
    ├── registry.json                # Machine-readable component data
    ├── component_status.md          # Human-readable status dashboard
    └── categories/                  # Component categories
        ├── form_controls.md         # Form control components
        ├── feedback.md              # Feedback components
        ├── layout.md                # Layout components
        └── ...                      # Other categories
```

#### 2. Component Registry Schema (registry.json)

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "text-field",
      "name": "TextField",
      "category": "form_controls",
      "subcategory": "custom_fields",
      "status": "implemented",
      "priority": "high",
      "requirementSource": "docs/Atavya_PRD.md:179",
      "implementation": "ui-library/components/view/CustomField/TextField.jsx",
      "stories": "ui-library/components/view/CustomField/TextField.stories.jsx",
      "dependencies": ["Input"],
      "lastUpdated": "2025-03-27"
    },
    {
      "id": "number-field",
      "name": "NumberField",
      "category": "form_controls",
      "subcategory": "custom_fields",
      "status": "planned",
      "priority": "medium",
      "requirementSource": "docs/Atavya_PRD.md:179",
      "implementation": null,
      "stories": null,
      "dependencies": ["Input"],
      "lastUpdated": "2025-03-27"
    }
    // ... other components
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Human-Readable Status Dashboard (component_status.md)

```markdown
# Component Status Dashboard

## Form Controls - Custom Fields

| Component | Status | Priority | Dependencies | Last Updated |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| ✅ TextField | Implemented | High | Input | 2025-03-27 |
| ✅ SelectField | Implemented | High | Select | 2025-03-27 |
| ✅ MultiSelectField | Implemented | High | Select | 2025-03-27 |
| ✅ DateField | Implemented | High | DatePicker | 2025-03-27 |
| ✅ CheckboxField | Implemented | High | Checkbox | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ NumberField | Planned | Medium | Input | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ PhoneField | Planned | Medium | Input | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ EmailField | Planned | Medium | Input | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ ColorPickerField | Planned | Low | ColorPicker | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ LookupField | Planned | High | Select, Modal | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ StatusPickerField | Planned | Medium | Select | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ FormulaField | Planned | Low | Input | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ RichTextField | Planned | Medium | RichTextEditor | 2025-03-27 |
| ⏳ FileAttachmentField | Planned | High | FileUploader | 2025-03-27 |
```

### Integration with Work Units

The component registry would be linked to work units:

1. Work units would reference specific components they address
2. Components would track which work unit implemented them
3. New work units could be automatically suggested based on planned components

### Framework Enhancement

This enhancement would be implemented at the project level first, but could be promoted to the central framework if proven effective. It would:

1. Add a new `component_registry` module to the framework
2. Update the project initializer to create the registry structure
3. Provide tools for maintaining and updating the registry
4. Integrate with conversation tracking to monitor component discussions

## Benefits

1. **Improved Tracking**: Clear visibility into component implementation status
2. **Requirements Traceability**: Direct links between requirements and implementation
3. **Better Planning**: Ability to prioritize and plan component development
4. **Enhanced Communication**: Common reference for discussing component status
5. **Automated Suggestions**: AI can suggest next components to implement based on dependencies and priorities

## Next Steps

1. Create the component registry structure for the Atavya-Fresh project
2. Populate the registry with all planned and implemented components
3. Update work units to reference specific components
4. Test the system with a few component implementations
5. Evaluate for potential inclusion in the central framework
