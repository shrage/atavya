## Notes and Decisions
- All work units must go through explicit approval gates
- Implementation cannot start without user approval
- Traceability must be established before implementation
- Architecture alignment must be verified at each gate
- Work unit hierarchy must be explicitly defined and approved

## Documentation Enhancements
- Create approval process documentation
- Enhance work unit templates with approval gates
- Add traceability matrix templates
- Create architecture alignment guidelines
- Add implementation gate documentation

## Next Steps
1. Update core framework files with approval gate protocols
2. Create enhanced work unit templates with approval gates
3. Implement traceability enforcement mechanisms
4. Add architecture alignment validation
5. Create approval notification system
