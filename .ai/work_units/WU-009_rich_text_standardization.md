# Work Unit: WU-009 - Rich Text Standardization

## Status Summary
- **Type**: Enhancement
- **Status**: Completed
- **Start Date**: 2025-03-27
- **Completion**: 6/6 components (100%)

## Overview
This work unit focuses on standardizing all rich text editing components across the Atavya-Fresh UI library by updating them to use the new core RichTextEditor component. This will ensure a consistent editing experience with advanced features like block-based editing, slash commands, mentions, and file attachments across all components that support rich text input.

## Parent Work Unit
- **[WU-008_custom_field_components.md](./WU-008_custom_field_components.md)**: This work unit is a child of WU-008, which implemented the core UI components including the RichTextEditor. The standardization effort in this work unit (WU-009) builds upon the RichTextEditor component created in WU-008 to ensure consistent rich text editing across the entire library.

## Goals
- Identify all components that support or should support rich text editing
- Update each component to use the core RichTextEditor component
- Ensure all rich text components share the same feature set and behavior
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing implementations
- Add documentation and examples for the new rich text features

## Technical Requirements

### Core RichTextEditor Features
All updated components should support these features from the core RichTextEditor:

1. **Block-Based Editing**
   - Support for different block types (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
   - Ability to reorder and nest blocks

2. **Slash Commands**
   - Quick access to formatting options and block types
   - Component-specific commands where appropriate

3. **Rich Content Support**
   - Links with unfurls/previews
   - File and image attachments
   - Tables and structured content
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting

4. **Collaboration Features**
   - Mentions and tagging
   - Comments and annotations
   - Real-time collaboration where applicable

5. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - ARIA attributes

### Component-Specific Considerations

Each component may need specific configurations:

- **RichTextField**: Full feature set for general-purpose editing
- **MessageComposer**: Optimized for quick message composition with mentions
- **CommentField**: Simplified interface focused on comments and mentions
- **EmailTemplateEditor**: Specialized for email template creation
- **MarkdownField**: Focus on markdown compatibility
- **InlineEditableText**: Minimal interface for quick inline edits

## Implementation Approach

1. **Phase 1: Core Updates**
   - Update RichTextField as the reference implementation
   - Document the integration pattern for other components

2. **Phase 2: Communication Components**
   - Update MessageComposer and CommentField
   - Focus on mention and collaboration features

3. **Phase 3: Specialized Editors**
   - Implement EmailTemplateEditor and MarkdownField
   - Add specialized features for each use case

4. **Phase 4: Utility Components**
   - Update InlineEditableText and any remaining components
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all components

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each updated component
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Visual regression tests to ensure UI consistency
- Accessibility testing for all components
- Performance testing, especially for large documents

## Documentation Requirements

- Update component documentation with new features
- Create migration guides for existing implementations
- Add examples for common use cases
- Document feature flags and configuration options
- Create tutorials for advanced features (slash commands, mentions, etc.)

## Implementation Progress
- **Completed Components**: 6
- **Planned Components**: 0
- **Total Components**: 6
- **Completion Percentage**: 100%

     - Integration with storage services

## Parent Unit Impact
The completion of this work unit affects the parent unit (WU-008) in the following ways:

- The RichTextEditor component in WU-008 should be marked as completed with all checklist items checked
- The completion percentage of WU-008 should increase from 78% to 79% (67/85 components)
- The documentation in WU-008 should reference the standardized rich text components
- The implementation approach in WU-008 should be updated to reflect the standardization pattern
