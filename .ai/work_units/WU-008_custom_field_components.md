## Related Work Units
- **[WU-009_rich_text_standardization.md](./WU-009_rich_text_standardization.md)**: Implements standardization of rich text editing across all components using the core RichTextEditor component. This work unit was spawned from the RichTextEditor implementation in WU-008 and focuses on updating all existing rich text components to use the new core component.

## Implementation Progress
- **Completed Components**: 67
- **Planned Components**: 18
- **Total Components**: 85
- **Completion Percentage**: 79%

## Remaining Work
- Implement remaining components across all categories
- Enhance existing components with additional features
- Ensure consistent API patterns across all components
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Complete Storybook documentation for all components
- Verify accessibility compliance

## Transition Strategy

The original `library.md` file will be deprecated once this transition is complete. During the transition period:

1. This work unit file is now the source of truth for component status
2. Updates should only be made to this file, not the original `library.md`
3. The original file is preserved for historical reference only

## Next Steps
1. Focus on high-priority remaining components
2. Standardize component APIs and patterns
3. Improve documentation and testing

### Implementation Priorities
1. Custom Field components (LookupField)
2. Navigation components (Breadcrumbs)
3. Data visualization components (Table, List)
4. Remaining feedback components (Toast, Tooltip)
