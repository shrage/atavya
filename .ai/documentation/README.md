# Centralized Knowledge Documentation

This directory contains the centralized knowledge documentation for the Atavya-Fresh project, serving as a single source of truth for various domains and topics across multiple work units.

## Documentation Categories

The documentation is organized into four categories:

### [Technical Documentation](./technical/)
Implementation details, API specifications, code architecture, and development guidelines for the Atavya-Fresh project.

### [User Documentation](./user/)
User guides, how-to instructions, feature explanations, and tutorials for using Atavya-Fresh components.

### [Feature Documentation](./feature/)
Feature specifications, requirements, behavior definitions, and acceptance criteria for Atavya-Fresh features.

### [Architecture Documentation](./architecture/)
System architecture, component relationships, data models, and integration points for the Atavya-Fresh platform.

## Purpose

This centralized documentation system ensures that:

1. Knowledge is accumulated across multiple work units
2. A single source of truth is maintained for each domain/topic
3. New work units have access to all prior knowledge
4. Contributions from different work units are tracked
5. Documentation stays current as work units are completed

## Integration with Work Units

Work units contribute to this documentation through their Documentation Updates section, which specifies:
- Which documents to update
- What sections to modify
- What content to add or change
- The rationale for the updates

When a work unit is completed, the specified documentation updates are implemented, ensuring that the centralized documentation always reflects the current state of the project.

## Documentation Maintenance

The documentation is maintained through:
- Automatic updates when work units are completed
- Regular reviews for accuracy and completeness
- Conflict resolution when multiple work units affect the same documentation
- Version tracking for significant changes
