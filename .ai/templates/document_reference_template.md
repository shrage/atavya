## Implementation Notes

When implementing document references in conversations:

1. Always use absolute paths for links to ensure they work correctly
2. Include status information for any document type that has a status field
3. Provide brief context about the document when first referencing it
4. For hierarchical documents (like parent-child work units), always mention the relationship
5. Use consistent formatting across all document types
