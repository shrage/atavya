## Gap Analysis

### New Requirements
[Requirements identified in the mock that are not in existing documentation]
- [REQ-HVAC-011]: Equipment performance history and trending - New requirement for historical performance data not previously documented
- [REQ-HVAC-V001]: HVAC-specific color scheme with status indicators - Visual requirement not explicitly stated in requirements
- [REQ-HVAC-I001]: Real-time data updates without page refresh - Interaction requirement not explicitly stated

### Conflicting Requirements
[Requirements that conflict with existing documentation]
- [REQ-HVAC-004]: Temperature zone management - Mock shows more advanced visual interface than originally specified
- [REQ-HVAC-007]: Compliance reporting - Mock shows integrated reporting rather than separate module as originally specified

### New Components Needed
[Components identified that don't exist in the current library]
- Temperature Zone Map: Interactive visualization of temperature zones
- Fault Diagnostic Panel: Specialized component for fault display and resolution
- Weather Integration Widget: Component for displaying weather data and impact

### Components to Modify
[Existing components that need modification]
- BaseCard: Extend for equipment status display
- CalendarComponent: Enhance for maintenance scheduling
- ChartComponent: Extend for energy efficiency metrics
- AlertComponent: Modify for HVAC-specific alerts and notifications

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority Order
1. Equipment Status Monitoring (core functionality)
2. Temperature Zone Management (key user need)
3. Fault Detection and Diagnostics (critical for operations)
4. Maintenance Schedule Management (important for planning)
5. Energy Efficiency Analytics (valuable but can be phased)

### Technical Considerations
- Real-time data handling will require efficient polling or WebSocket implementation
- Interactive map functionality may require SVG manipulation library
- Chart visualizations should use a flexible charting library that supports all required chart types
- Mobile responsiveness will require careful component design for different screen sizes

### Potential Challenges
- Integration with multiple Building Management Systems - Mitigate with standardized API adapter pattern
- Real-time performance with many equipment items - Mitigate with pagination and optimized data loading
- Complex interactive visualizations on mobile - Mitigate with simplified mobile-specific views
