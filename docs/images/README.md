# Atavya Conceptual Diagrams

This folder would contain the following conceptual diagrams to help understand the platform:

1. High-level system architecture
2. Component architecture
3. Data model diagrams
4. UI component registry flow
5. Entity inheritance model
6. Industry customization workflows

Note: For implementation with AI code generators, you would need to convert the mermaid diagrams in the markdown files to actual image files (PNG, SVG, etc.) and place them in this directory.
