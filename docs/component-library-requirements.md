# Atavya Component Library & Viewer Requirements

## Overview

The Atavya platform requires a comprehensive component library and a dedicated component viewer application. This system will allow UI developers to test and showcase components in isolation, provide documentation for component usage, and serve as a living style guide for the platform.

## Goals

- Create a structured component directory for organized component development
- Provide a standalone component viewer application for testing and showcasing components
- Enable developers to view components with sample data without launching the entire application
- Serve as documentation for UI developers to understand available components and their usage
- Standardize component implementation patterns and ensure consistency
- Facilitate component development and testing in isolation

## Component Directory Structure

The component library will be organized in the following structure:

```
/src/components/
│
├── core/                  # Core UI building blocks
│   ├── Button/
│   ├── Input/
│   ├── Select/
│   ├── Modal/
│   └── ...
│
├── common/                # Common components used across the platform
│   ├── EntityHeader/
│   ├── CommunicationTab/
│   ├── FilesTab/
│   ├── CustomFieldsTab/
│   └── ...
│
├── default/               # Default implementations for entity views
│   ├── DefaultCustomerList/
│   ├── DefaultCustomerDetail/
│   ├── DefaultTaskList/
│   ├── DefaultTaskDetail/
│   └── ...
│
├── industries/            # Industry-specific components
│   ├── hvac/
│   │   ├── HvacServiceJobList/
│   │   ├── HvacServiceJobDetail/
│   │   ├── HvacTechnicianDetail/
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── property-management/
│   │   ├── PropertyList/
│   │   ├── PropertyDetail/
│   │   ├── LeaseDetail/
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   └── professional-services/
│       ├── ProjectDetail/
│       ├── TimeEntryList/
│       └── ...
│
└── custom/                # Organization-specific custom components
    ├── CustomHvacJobDetail/
    ├── CustomCustomerForm/
    └── ...
```

## Component Structure

Each component should follow a consistent structure:

```
/ComponentName/
├── ComponentName.jsx       # The main component implementation
├── ComponentName.css       # Component-specific styles (if not using CSS-in-JS)
├── ComponentName.test.jsx  # Component tests
├── ComponentName.stories.jsx # Component stories for the viewer
├── SampleData.js           # Sample data for testing and stories
├── README.md               # Component documentation
└── index.js                # Export file
```

## Component Viewer Application

The Component Viewer application will:

1. Run independently from the main application
2. Display all available components in a categorized menu
3. Allow viewing components with various props and configurations
4. Provide sample data for realistic component rendering
5. Show component documentation, including:
   - Props and their types
   - Usage examples
   - Best practices
   - Design guidelines

### Technical Approach

- The Component Viewer will be built using Storybook.js
- Each component will have associated "stories" showing different states and configurations
- Sample data will be provided to mimic realistic usage
- Components can be viewed in different viewport sizes to test responsiveness
- Documentation will be embedded within the viewer

### Sample Data

Sample data will be defined for each component type:

- Generic entity data for BaseEntity components
- Industry-specific sample data for specialized components
- Various states (empty, loading, error, etc.) for all components
- Edge cases (long text, missing data, etc.) to ensure robust rendering

## Integration with Development Workflow

The Component Viewer should be:

1. Part of the continuous integration pipeline to ensure components render correctly
2. Accessible to designers for UI review and feedback
3. Deployable as a standalone application for reference
4. Used during code reviews to validate component implementations

## Success Criteria

- All UI components have corresponding entries in the Component Viewer
- New components are added to the Component Viewer as part of the development process
- UI developers can test components in isolation without launching the full application
- Documentation is maintained alongside components
- Component reuse increases and UI inconsistencies decrease

## Technical Requirements

- The Component Viewer must load quickly and be easy to use
- Development server for the Component Viewer should be separate from the main application
- Components should be able to mock their dependencies for isolated testing
- The Component Viewer should support both production and development builds
- Sample data should be easily configurable for different scenarios
