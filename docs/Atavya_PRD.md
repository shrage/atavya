**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Product Name:** Atavya
**Core Objective:** Provide a flexible, industry-adaptable automation and efficiency platform with customizable modules for various business sectors, built on a common entity framework with dashboard-first architecture.

---

### 1. **Overview**
Atavya is a configurable process-automation system that provides a core set of capabilities that can be tailored to specific industry needs. The platform allows specialized configurations for different industries (HVAC services, property management, professional services, etc.) while maintaining a consistent core architecture. The entire application is structured to support departmental dashboards built in Apache Superset, with deep integrations into n8n automation, PostgreSQL data storage, and event-driven architecture. The backend is built in .NET (C#) with Entity Framework, frontend in ReactJS, and scheduling/dispatch powered by FullCalendar.

The design approach takes inspiration from **Notion-style design**: clean, minimal, block-based, and highly flexible. It emphasizes clarity, ease of navigation, and responsive layouts while allowing structured content to be created and manipulated fluidly. Layouts are soft, whitespace-optimized, with a strong focus on typography and user clarity.

#### 5.1 Dynamic Entities & Extensibility
- Every entity (Task, Customer, etc.) inherits from a common **BaseEntity**
  - Shared capabilities: comments, attachments, audit log, lookup fields, status history
  - Each entity includes a **basic rich text document field** for descriptions and notes
- Each list view inherits from a common **BaseList**
  - Shared UI behaviors: filtering, grouping, sorting, batch editing
- Entities can be extended with **custom fields** of various types:
  - Text, Number, Phone, Email, Dropdown, Labels, Color pickers
  - Lookup (1:1 or 1:many to other entities), Status pickers, Formula fields
  - Rich Text fields for advanced formatting
  - File Attachment fields
- Formula fields can:
  - Calculate values dynamically (on-the-fly display only)
  - Or persist their output to the database (for automation or indexing)
- Lists can include lookup columns to link entities across the system
- Data model follows a **hybrid schema**:
  - One central table stores common metadata for all entities
  - Entity-specific data is stored in normalized separate tables per entity type

#### 5.2 UI Component Registry System
- Core UI components are registered in a central registry
- Registry maps entity types to UI components
- Default mapping provided for all basic entity types
- Industry-specific mappings can override defaults
- Custom mappings can be defined at the organization level
- Each mapping contains:
  - Entity type
  - UI component for list view
  - UI component for detail view
  - UI component for creation/editing
  - Custom tabs configuration
  - Related entity configurations

#### 5.3 Workflow and List-Specific Logic
- Each list can define and manage its own workflow independently
- **Elsa Workflows** will be the workflow engine for all lists and list items
- Workflows will support:
  - State machines, branching, conditions
  - Human interaction steps (approvals, actions)
  - Time-based transitions and scheduled triggers
  - Integration with external systems via HTTP, Kafka, or webhooks
- Industry templates include pre-configured workflows
- Organizations can customize workflows for their specific needs

#### 5.4 Multi-Tenant Platform Structure
- Platform designed as multi-tenant with industry isolation:
  - Each organization has its own isolated data
  - Industry templates applied at organization creation
  - Cross-industry capabilities available to all organizations
  - Organizations can customize their instance within industry parameters
