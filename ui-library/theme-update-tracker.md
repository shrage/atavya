# Atavya UI Component Theme Update Tracker

This file tracks the progress of updating all Atavya UI components to use the Tailwind theme colors directly and follow our new component development guidelines.

## Guidelines Summary

1. **Use Tailwind theme colors** instead of hardcoded values
   - Use `bg-primary` instead of `bg-[#7E57C2]`
   - Use `text-text-primary` instead of `text-[#2C2C2D]`

2. **Leverage existing building blocks** instead of creating custom implementations
   - Use Button component instead of creating custom buttons
   - Compose complex components from simpler ones

3. **Maintain consistent prop naming** across components
   - Use `variant` for style variations
   - Use `size` for size variations
   - Use `disabled` for disabled state
